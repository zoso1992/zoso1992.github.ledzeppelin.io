	<p>The equipment listed as used by Jimmy Page is not a complete list, what follows is an almost complete listing of the equipment used by Page onstage with Led-Zeppelin from 1968 to 1980. Equipment that was used in the studio for the recording of the albums is largely unknown save for several instances as well as the occasional overlapping of instruments and effects used onstage that were also used in the studio, like for instance the 1959 #1 Les Paul that was used almost exclusively onstage and in the studio from mid-1969 until the end of Led-Zeppelin. On the other hand Page's Supro amplifier was used exclusively in the studio throughout Led-Zeppelin's existence and it's use is widely documented though the exact make and specifications of it have been witheld by Page over the years.</p>

	<p>Like with the numerous instruments, amps and effects used by Page both onstage and in the studio, a comprehensive list of equipment used by John Paul Jones in the studio is unfathomable and difficult to compile save for a few select instruments, Jones' 1962 jazz bass was his sole bass used on stage and in the studio until roughly 1971 when his '52 Telecaster Bass is first seen. Even less is known about Jones' amplifier use in the studio save the confirmation that his Acoustic 360 were used.</p>

	<p>Unlike Page and Jones who used an extensive variety of equipment in the studio as well as on stage, Bonham's exact kits used and owned are well documented as once he was endorsed by and started using Ludwig in January 1969, he never used anything different aside from various colors and finished and only the extra percussive instruments would vary, like his timpani, gong, and bongo drums.</p>
