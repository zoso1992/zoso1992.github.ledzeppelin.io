		<p>This site is dedicated to a band that is often cited as being the greatest Rock 'n Roll band in history. Led-Zeppelin, one of the highest selling artists in the history of audio recording and one of the most influential bands to exist in the past 50 years. Rather than being a band that only features the talents of a charismatic lead singer or a virtuoso of a guitarist, Led-Zeppelin was instead a band of four frontmen. The talents of the whole were indivisible of the four individuals. All four combined to create a fifth element that was evident in the band's records and live concerts.</p><br>
		<p>What this site aims to do is to give it's readers a brief but in-depth look at the band while it was active, as well as a glimpse into the lives of its members, while also detailing information about their record releases and their triumphant return for one night only in London 2007.</p><br>
		<p>Whether you're a lifelong fan or a new fan looking to further your knowledge, something for everyone can be found here, with a look back to a time when giants walked the earth....</p>
